        <p class="about">You have 3 canonical lives. It only counts when you are killed by someone.
            Build your own nation, fight against other nations. Sell items and do whatever you want, just have fun and make sure others have fun too. You get gold from doing the various tasks in OblivionSMP, you can also get gold from killing others. Use that gold to invest in materials and buy things from other people. You can scam people, blow up things, kill others, start wars, however make sure others have fun as well as you.
